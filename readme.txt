This project is website where a user can create art with a basic Etch-a-Sketch

As part of this project, I will be more detailed, clear and intentional with my git commits. I have implemented a
commit template in order to ensure consistency.

For now I am finished with the project.

However, some things I would like to add inb the future are:
    * Shadows to make elements pop
    * Some simple animations
    * Ability to increase / decrease the cursor size / shape


I will be back to refactor the code once I learn more and easier ways to accomplish things.
